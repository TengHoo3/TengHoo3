Hi there! Thanks for visiting my Github profile. I am an AI/ML Engineer coming from a non-technical background with specific focus in Computer Vision and Data Science. I believe my experiences outside of the machine learning world are what brings the most value to machine learning. Reach out to me for any discussions about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science!

<h3> What do I currently do? </h3>

💻 I am currently an AI Engineer building an ID Fraud Detection model as part of the eKYC development pipeline, one of the first few fraud detection models in SEA

♒ I am active on Upwork for exciting new opportunites on Machine Learning, Data Science, Web Development and MLOps / Deployment

🏋️‍♂️ I am a gym enthusiast and enjoy sports / exercise outside of AI / Machine Learning

💡 Always looking for interesting new projects to work on
